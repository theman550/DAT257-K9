# DAT257-K9
Project for course DAT257

# Rules
- Never work on the master branch, always work on a feature branch
- When you want to push something, push it to your feature branch, then do a pull request
- Always use linter (e.g. eslint) before you do a pull request
- Always write tests for your code, use test driven development (TDD)
- Create meaningful commits and write informational commit messages

# Definition of done
- Acceptance critera must be fulfilled. 
- All tests must pass.
- The design should follow established design principled based on mockups. 
- Code style should remain consistent. Preferably with the help of linters.

# Configuring frontend's environment
The frontend can be run in different environments depending on the variable "REACT_APP_ENV".
Different environments changes certain environment-specific definitions such as API url, and others.
"development" is default, to explicitly set environment type:
```
set "REACT_APP_ENV=production" && npm start
```
where 'production' can be either development, testing, or production.

To read and use an environment-specific variable in your code; simply import the config and read from it:
```
import config from './config';
...
console.log(config.api.url);
```

# Linting frontend
In [your working directory]/frontend
```
npm run lint
```
Fix all errors/warnings before creating a pull request.

# Styling frontend
- Try to the best of your ability to follow established design mockups.
- Style your components to be responsive. With the right CSS units, responsiveness should come naturally!
- Follow [CSS best practices](https://gist.github.com/basham/2175a16ab7c60ce8e001); choose the right units!
- Consistent styling is achieved by styled-component's ThemeProvider. Your styles should depend on these properties! See theme definitions in 'frontend/src/themes'.
- Apply color according to the agreed color scheme.
- Refer to colors by those defined in 'frontend/src/themes', for example:
```
const Label = styled.label`
    font-family: Kufam, sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-size: 0.8em;
    color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.inactive};
`;
```
- Apply spacing and padding according to the theme, exceptions are acceptable though, for example:
```
const CardHeader = styled.div`
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;

    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-end;
    justify-content: space-between;

    box-sizing: content-box;
    padding: ${(props) => props.theme.padding.section};
`;
```
